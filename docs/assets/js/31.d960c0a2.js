I work with Vue.js in the front-end of my projects. So, I wanted to use this tool to make my site. But it wouldn't be practical to build it only using vue. That's when I met Vuepress. With this tool I can write pages on markdown, using vue templates. Vuepress transforms these markdown files into HTML files, with its respective JS and CSS. It even helps me with something else, I can host it on github pages, which allows for static files to be deployed. That is, there is no code written by me running on the backend.
