## Bahia - BR | [albertto.programmer@gmail.com](mailto:albertto.programmer@gmail.com)

I'm a web developer passionate about technology. My heart beats faster for back-end development, but I also like front-end. Currently, I'm about to finish my Computer Science Associate Degree, and I work as a developer, in personal projects, and also as an employee. I love learning, and I always look for challenges that can consolidate my knowledge, and that may teach me a little about entrepreneurship.

Main Stack: JavaScript (Node, Express, Vue), PHP (Laravel), MySQL, or MongoDB.

Knowledge in: Git, Docker, Ruby on Rails, Java, CSS (+ SASS|SCSS), Flutter, Wordpress.
